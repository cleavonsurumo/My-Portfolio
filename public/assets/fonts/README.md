Place the DM Mono WOFF/WOFF2 files here to enable self-hosting.

Required filenames (these match the CSS in public/assets/css/main.css):
- dmmono-regular-webfont.woff2
- dmmono-regular-webfont.woff
- dmmono-medium-webfont.woff2
- dmmono-medium-webfont.woff
- dmmono-light-webfont.woff2
- dmmono-light-webfont.woff
- dmmono-mediumitalic-webfont.woff2
- dmmono-mediumitalic-webfont.woff

How to obtain the files:
- Option A: Download from a font provider or the original license source (Google Fonts) and rename files to match the required names.
- Option B: Use the helper script `download-fonts.ps1` included here (you must supply direct download URLs).

Security and licensing:
- Confirm the font license allows self-hosting (DM Mono is available under an open license via Google Fonts at time of writing).

After placing files here, restart your dev server (Next.js) if needed so static assets are served.

If you want, paste the font files into this folder and I can finish the verification and mark the task done.
